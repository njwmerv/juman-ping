Fixed jumping, so now can only jump if on ground or platform (half second window)
Platforms fall at about same rate as player (get faster than it somehow)
    but close enough at the start of fall it's fine
To do:
    On wall check for wall jumps? (not sure if this should be in) - (11/10, just decided no wall jumps!)
    Level completion - (11/10: goal add: watch tutourial)
    More levels 
    Sound
    Sprites

Created way to add more levels
Reorganized everything into parent class (Object) and sublclasses
